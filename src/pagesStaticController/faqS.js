                                    If you are placing an order for corrective eyeglasses, sunglasses with correction or corrective contact lenses, then we will need your current prescription to ensure that we send you the right products. The values we require are your spherical values, your cylindrical value and axis (if applicable) and pupillary distance (PD) value.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Please ensure that your prescription is less than 1 year old as your eyesight can change during that time.
                                </p>

                                    It’s not recommended to carry over your prescription from eyeglasses to contacts or the other way around. This is because the contact lens sits directly on your cornea and as such the measurements dier from your glasses prescription.

(Most vision insurance plans do.) If the form asks for a provider name, ours is INNOVATIVE VISION OPTIC.
